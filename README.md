This program is run in google colab environment and created in groups.

The challenges that we'll solve from <code>menu_mcd.csv</code> dataset include:
<li>a. How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain?</li>
<li>b. How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake?</li>
<li>c. Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value?</li>
<li>d. What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs?</li>
<li>e. What is the least number of items could you order from the menu to meet one day's nutritional requirements?</li>
<br>
We solve the five challenges above with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
